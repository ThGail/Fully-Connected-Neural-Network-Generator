# Fully-Connected-Neural-Network-Generator
Python class that helps to manage Fully Connected Neural Networks

Welcome to my Fully-Connected-Neural-Network-Generator !
I created it to improve my coding skills and increase my networks understanding in a program environment.
This program contains a class with a few tools to manage your network. By using it, you will be able to create and train a neural network with whatever dimensions you want. The details are in the program's sheet.
A few explanations are also in the in the program, follow the #. 

I will try to update the program, two importants things are missing : 
  - the network does not use biases
  - there is only the sigmoide as an activation function

Feel free to use it. Tell me in what crazy project you are going to use it or the updates you did ! 
Bye !
